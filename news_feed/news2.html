            <p>A Halloween party on Oct. 25 at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in D.C. featured candy, paper airplanes — and concerning for some attendees — a station where children were encouraged to help “Build the Wall” with their own personalized bricks.</p>

            <p>Guenter Schabowski scratches his head, puts on his glasses, hesitates, then fumbles with his handwritten notes.  A member of the Politburo of East Germany's communist party, and its spokesman, this member of the inner ruling circle of the "workers' and peasants' state", as the German Democratic Republic was known, just announced to a few flabbergasted journalists the fall of the Berlin Wall.  Was it the result of a misunderstanding in the communist hierarchy, caught flat-footed by events, or a calculated gesture by the East German dictatorship which had reached the end of the line?</p>

            <h2>‘Not our mission’: private fire crews protect the insured, not the public</h2>
            <p>Date: Sun, 03 Nov 2019 06:00:22 -0500</p>
            <a href='https://news.yahoo.com/not-mission-private-fire-crews-110022972.html'>News link</a>
            <p>Agencies hired to protect assets look like first responders but, if a fire puts them in danger, they can become a liabilityFirefighters work to defend homes from an approaching wildfire in Sonoma, California. Photograph: Jim Urquhart/ReutersThe engines, big and small, came from all over the country to fight the Kincade fire in the Sonoma county wine region of California. There were trucks from Nevada, South Dakota, Colorado – and from the wildfire protection unit of home insurer AIG.As fires have increasingly encroached on development in California’s wildlands in recent years, communities are grappling with a new paradigm of risk. If the fire creates an existential crisis for people living in high-risk areas, it also creates one for the companies that insure their homes.Insurers of houses, timber and agriculture have contracted with private firefighting agencies for decades. But now, thanks to longer, more devastating fire seasons, the business is booming.While some wealthy communities and individuals have contracted their own private firefighting services to defend mansions on hilltops from flying embers, the majority of these agencies work on behalf of insurance companies. And as fire risk extends to more homes in California’s flammable brushland and forest, these crews are becoming a fixture in middle class neighborhoods. It is something of a return to a pre-American civil war model of pay-for-play firefighting, before the government employed first responders.Firefighters protect a Pacific Palisades area home in Los Angeles from the flames of a wildfire. Photograph: Christian Monterrosa/Associated Press“Any policyholder that would like to have wildfire services, all they need to do is shop from more than a dozen insurers out there that have these services,” said David Torgerson, president of Wildfire Defense Systems, a private firefighting firm. “It’s not a special policy. It’s not something that’s exclusive. It’s something that the insurance industry has found brings value.”Insured losses for the 2018 California wildfire season topped $12bn. Insurance companies are looking for any way to reduce payouts in the future, whether by raising rates, dropping coverage, or putting new risk mitigation measures into place – including, in some cases, these kinds of private fire crews.The services they provide focus primarily on fire prevention mitigation – cutting back vegetation, creating clear defensible space around structures and providing consultations on other home hardening work. As in the Kincade fire, private crews also sometimes access mandatory evacuation zones during active wildfires to protect valuable assets while the embers are flying – a move that makes some government firefighters and local authorities uneasy.“Generally speaking, from our perspective, we have found that private fire crews are not first responders,” said Carroll Wills, communications director for California Professional Firefighters.Firefighters watch from a home in the Pacific Palisades area as a helicopter drops water on a wildfire. Photograph: Christian Monterrosa/Associated PressPrivate fire crews travel into evacuation zones in trucks equipped with water tanks and hoses and retardant, looking nearly identical to their government counterparts – though their sole task is to protect specific insured homes.Torgerson, president of Wildfire Defense Systems, noted that while his teams are capable of fighting fires, “that’s not our mission in this case”.“Our task with the insurance industry is more so to prepare the homes and secure them, prior to and after the fire, and contribute to the survivability,” he said.“Our [wildfire protection unit] teams are not private firefighters,” said Matt Gallagher, a spokesman for AIG – yet they station engines with full tanks in evacuation zones during wildfires that can turn dangerous within seconds.Lawmakers grew concerned that civilians would see these private engines and get a false sense of security about remaining in evacuation zones. Government firefighters voiced complaints about rolling onto a scene, believing the area to be fully evacuated, only to find private fire crews who had not alerted incident command.In the 2018 Woolsey fire, Kim Kardashian famously hired private firefighters to save her $50m Calabasas mansion – a crew that, said Wills, never told anyone of their plans. “That’s just incredibly dangerous,” Wills said. A helicopter drops water on a brush fire during the Woolsey Fire in Malibu, California. Photograph: Ringo HW Chiu/Associated PressPrior to the 2018 fire season, California lawmakers passed a bill requiring private crews to alert public incident command and obtain permission before entering an evacuation zone. The law codified a best-practice guideline put in place in 2008. Torgerson, who founded his company that same year, said his company has always followed these directives, and will continue to do so now that the law is in effect.“We’ve responded to more than 650 wildfires since 2008, and more than 97% of the time, we’ve been granted access to the evacuation zones to conduct these insurance missions,” he said. “We’ve coordinated with hundreds of incident command teams.”Torgerson said he does not know why his crews were not permitted 3% of the time.“We’re fully qualified under state and federal certification and training processes,” he said. “We are the same resources that the federal government hires.”But their mission is fundamentally different. Government firefighters are tasked with saving life, first and foremost, so if the fires turn and the private crews require rescue, “they are a liability”, Wills said.“We understand that when people see these massive fires, there’s a tendency to say, ‘Well, more is better’,” Wills said. “From our perspective, more really isn’t better. The more that we need is more fully trained and battle-tested, front-line firefighters and emergency responders.”</p>

            <h2>Indian capital Delhi diverts flights and restricts cars as millions endure &#39;eye-burning&#39; smog</h2>

            <p>New Delhi banned half the Indian capital's private cars from its roads on Monday as the megacity's 20 million people spluttered with stinging eyes in the worst pollution in three years. As smog levels exceeded those of Beijing by more than three times, authorities also parked a van with an air purifier near the Taj Mahal - the iconic 17th-century marble mausoleum 250 kilometres (150 miles) south of Delhi - in a bid to clean the air in its surroundings, the Press Trust of India reported. With the pollution causing a rush of respiratory complaints at hospitals and the diversion of 37 flights on Sunday, a new law came into effect restricting cars from the capital's roads to alternative days, depending on if their number plate ends in an odd or even number. More than 600 police teams were deployed at road intersections in the capital with the power to hand out fines of 4,000 rupees (£44) to transgressors Exempt from the restrictions were Delhi's seven million motorbikes and scooters, public transport and cars carrying only women, stoking criticism that the measures were ineffective.

"Eyes are burning. Pollution is that bad." Construction was banned temporarily late last week in the world's most polluted capital city, while schools have been closed until Wednesday, with the city government handing out free pollution masks to children. "I have a headache every day I wake up. It's suffocating to breathe sometimes. And inflammation in the nostrils and all. And eyes also. Like it kind of burns," Ankusha Kushi, a student, told AFP. As Delhiites woke up on Monday, levels of particulates measuring less than 2.5 microns - so tiny they enter deep into the respiratory tract - were at 613 micrograms per cubic metre of air, according to the US embassy in Delhi.

In central Delhi, the state air quality institute rated levels of the tiny particulates - which can be deadly over the long term - as "severe". Bollywood megastar Priyanka Chopra Jonas posted a selfie in pollution mask on Instagram and said it was "hard to shoot" in Delhi. "I can't even imagine what it must be like to live here under these conditions. We r blessed with air purifiers and masks. Pray for the homeless," she posted.

One study last year said that a million Indians died prematurely every year as a result. With a state election due in Delhi in early 2020, the crisis has also become a casualty of political bickering, with each side blaming the other. Mr Kejriwal, who likened Delhi to a "gas chamber" on Friday, said the city had done its part to curb pollution and that the burning of wheat stubble residue on farms outside the capital had to be stopped.</p>

            <p>Vietnam has arrested eight more people in connection with the deaths of 39 people found in a truck in Britain who are believed to be Vietnamese, police said Monday.  Eight women and 31 men were found in a refrigerated lorry in an industrial park in Essex, east of London last month, in a case that has shaken Britain and exposed the deadly risks of illegal migration from Vietnam into Europe.  British police initially said the victims were Chinese, but several Vietnamese families came forward to say they feared their relatives were on the truck.</p>

            <p>Evidence is mounting that wild North American bison are gradually shedding their genetic diversity across many of the isolated herds overseen by the U.S. government, weakening future resilience against disease and climate events in the shadow of human encroachment.  The extent of the creeping threat to herds overseen by the Department of Interior — the backbone of wild bison conservation efforts for North America — is coming into sharper focus amid advances in genetic studies.  It does not include Yellowstone National Park's herd of some 5,000 unfenced bison, the largest federal conservation herd that's seen by millions of people who visit the park annually.</p>

            <p>A pregnant woman is being celebrated as a hero for using an AR-15 rifle to save the lives of her husband and 11-year-old daughter after two men broke into the family's home Wednesday night.Two masked intruders broke into the Lithia, Florida home close to 9pm on Wednesday. One of the men grabbed the couple's 11-year-old daughter while both men violently attacked her father, Jeremy King. One of the men pistol-whipped him, and the other kicked him in the head several times, King said.“As soon as they had got the back door opened, they had a pistol on me and was grabbing my 11-year-old daughter,” King told Bay News 9.His wife, who is more than eight-months pregnant, peeked out of the back bedroom during the incident, at which point King said one of the intruders shot at her. She then retrieved the AR-15 and shot at the intruder, clipping him, according to King.“He made it from my back door to roughly 200 feet out in the front ditch before the AR did its thing,” King said.Authorities found the body of a man in a ditch nearby the house. King meanwhile said he has a fractured eye socket, fractured sinus cavity, a concussion, 20 stitches and three staples in his head.“Them guys came in with two normal pistols and my AR stopped it," King said, adding that his wife had "evened the playing field and kept them from killing me.”The AR-15 rifle was in the home legally, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office.</p>

            <p>Ethnic rebels in Myanmar have detained and interrogated a lawmaker and several Indian nationals, one of whom died, the rebels said on Monday, in the latest escalation of violence in the restive western state of Rakhine.  Tens of thousands of people have been displaced across Rakhine since clashes began in December, bringing fresh chaos to the region, from which more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims fled a military crackdown in 2017.  Sunday's incident was the first time foreigners have been abducted in the fighting between government troops and the Arakan Army, an ethnic armed group that recruits from the mostly Buddhist local majority in its quest for greater state autonomy.</p>

            <h2>Iraq’s Top Cleric Warns Iran to Stay Out</h2>
            <p>Date: Mon, 04 Nov 2019 09:29:03 -0500</p>
            <a href='https://news.yahoo.com/iraq-top-cleric-warns-iran-060002733.html'>News link</a>
            <p>(Bloomberg Opinion) -- To understand what Iraq’s Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani is saying, you have to translate him twice: first from Arabic to English, then from politesse to plain-speak. In the first translation, a key passage from his Friday sermon in the holy city of Karbala went like this: “No person or group, no side with a particular view, no regional or international actor may seize the will of the Iraqi people and impose its will on them.”The second translation: “Back off, Khamenei!”That is how it would have sounded to Sistani’s audience in Karbala, where it was read out for the ailing octogenarian by an aide; in the streets of Baghdad and other Iraqi cities, where a bloody crackdown on largely peaceful protesters has taken more than 200 lives; in the Iraqi parliament, where lawmakers are negotiating a response to the demonstrations; and in Tehran, where Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has been struggling to respond to the rising anti-Iran sentiment that undergirds uprisings in Iraq and Lebanon.Khamenei has unleashed Iran’s proxies in the streets — Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Shiite militias in Iraq — to intimidate the protesters. He has also dispatched his chief enforcer, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps commander Qassem Soleimani, to the Iraqi parliament, to rally Shiite parties behind the feckless Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi.But if anything, these responses will only fan the anger in the streets against Iranian interference in Iraqi and Lebanese politics. Not even Khamenei, who is practiced in the art of ignoring popular resentment, can have failed to notice the anti-Iran slogans echoing through Iraqi cities. Nor will it have escaped his attention that the loudest chanting comes from Iraqi Shiites, a community he expects to favor his Islamic Republic.  The Supreme Leader’s anxiety was palpable in his tweets on Thursday, when he tried to blame Tehran’s usual suspects — “the U.S., the Zionist regime, some Western countries, and the money of some reactionary countries” — for the protests.Sistani’s sermon was a riposte, designed to set Khamenei right. Although born in Iran, he is no fan of Khamenei and other hardliners in Tehran, preferring the likes of President Hassan Rouhani.Iraq’s Grand Ayatollah has been in a quandary over the protests. Every Iraqi government since 2005 has had his personal imprimatur: His word has united factions among the Shiite majority. Prime Minister Abdul-Mahdi, too, has his blessing. As such, Sistani is complicit in the corruption and ineptitude that have brought the Iraqis into the streets.His early pronouncements on the protests vacillated between bromides against corruption and calls on the protesters to abjure violence. But as the demonstrations have persisted, Sistani has grown progressively more critical of the government, blaming it for the violence.His Friday sermon puts him squarely on the protesters’ side. In addition to interfering Iranians, the leaders who have long benefited from his validation came under attack. As the politicians in Baghdad struggle to devise a response that will satisfy angry Iraqis, the so-called sage of Najaf warned that Iraqis have a right to a “referendum on the constitution” to change how they are governed. By invoking the prospect of a referendum, Sistani may have given the protesters a new focus for their energies, and Iraqi politicians a way to break the toxic pattern of inconclusive elections and compromise prime ministers. Much will depend on the reaction of another cleric, Moqtada al-Sadr, who has also taken the protesters’ side — even joining them in the streets — and has called for Abdul-Mahdi’s removal.Sadr, frequently described as a firebrand, has little in common with the preternaturally placid Sistani. But the prospect of the protests being led by one and backed by the other is certain to rattle turbaned heads in Tehran. And if Sistani and Sadr were to throw their combined weight behind demands for a referendum — and who knows, maybe even inspire emulation by the Lebanese — that might be the stuff of Khamenei’s nightmares.(Corrects photograph of Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani in article published Nov. 2.)To contact the author of this story: Bobby Ghosh at aghosh73@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Gibney at jgibney5@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Bobby Ghosh is a columnist and member of the Bloomberg Opinion editorial board.

            <h2>Central European governments accused of abusing European agriculture subsidies</h2>
            <p>Date: Sun, 03 Nov 2019 13:56:39 -0500</p>
            <a href='https://news.yahoo.com/central-european-governments-accused-abusing-185639281.html'>News link</a>
            <p>Central European governments have been systematically abusing the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy to enrich family members and political allies, an investigation claims.  The New York Times survey of subsidies in nine European countries found that millions of euros in agricultural subsidies had been directed to a handful of companies, often linked to national leaders. It alleged that the CAP had even underwritten “mafia-style land grabs” in Slovakia and Bulgaria.  Prominent beneficiaries reportedly include Andrej Babis, the billionaire prime minister of the Czech republic, who the paper says is linked to a company that received at least $42 million (£32 million) in subsidies last year.  Lukáš Wagenknecht, a senator from the opposition Pirate Party, last week filed a complaint against the European Council saying it should not allow Mr Babis to take part in the bloc’s budget discussions because his Agrofert conglomerate receives tens of millions of Euros in subsidies annually.  Mr Babis no longer owns the company and has denied a conflict of interests, but organisations including Transparency International claim that he remains its end beneficiary.   Andrej Babis, the Czech prime minister, denies a conflict of interest Credit: Martin Divisek/Bloomberg The paper also accused Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary, of abusing the EU’s subsidies to fund a system of patronage linked to land leases.   It cited Mr Orban’s sale of 12 state farms to close associates when he was prime minister between 1998 and 2002, which became eligible for large subsidies when Hungary joined the EU in 2004.  In 2015, five years after he returned to power, Mr Orban’s government began to sell and auction leases to hundreds of thousands of hectares at cut price rates, arranging for most of them go to businessmen with close connections of Fidesz.  The paper implies that this created a system of “modern feudalism” in which small farmers were left beholden to barons who received land eligible for European subsidies based on their loyalty to Mr Orban.   Individuals who are reported to have built up considerable landholdings include Mr Orbans family and close business and political allies.  The European Union supported farmers with 58.82 billion Euros (£50.8 billion) in 2018. Subsidies are meant to support food production, rural community development, and environmentally friendly farming.  The subsidies it provides are often crucial to the survival of small farmers across the bloc.  Ivan Haralampiev, the Bulgarian farmer whose cow Penka was at the centre of an outcry over EU agricultural regulations in 2018, told the Telegraph that he had bought cattle only because the subsidies they qualified for made it possible to live.  The Telegraph sought comment from Mr Orban's office.  A spokesman for the Hungarian government said: “The procedures in Hungary for administering EU agricultural subsidies fully satisfy EU rules and regulations for the management of these funds. Hungary is also fully compliant in the sale of state land, which is regulated by law. Furthermore, it should be noted, that concerning a plot of land larger than 1,000 hectares, subsidies for or sale of that plot must follow strict rules. The NYT’s questions and sources clearly reflect a biased preconception about the topic.”</p>

            <p>In the Indian town of Ayodhya, minority Muslims are feeling under siege as they await a Supreme Court ruling on a centuries-old religious dispute that has cast a shadow over their relations with the majority Hindu community.  After a tangle of legal cases, the Supreme Court in August decided to hear arguments every day in an effort to resolve the dispute over what should be built on the ruins of the 16th-century Babri Masjid, destroyed by a Hindu mob in 1992.  The uproar over the mosque triggered some of India's deadliest riots, in which nearly 2,000 people, most of them Muslim, were killed.</p>

            <h2>Late-week storm could spell wintry weather for the mid-Atlantic</h2>
            <p>Date: Sun, 03 Nov 2019 11:39:56 -0500</p>
            <a href='https://news.yahoo.com/week-storm-could-spell-wintry-163956591.html'>News link</a>
            <p>A storm budding in the south-central U.S. earlier in the week, will take aim at the East Coast, and could deliver both heavy rain and wintry weather.An active pattern will continue to bring several storms from the center of the country to the Eastern Seaboard throughout the week. The presence of many moving parts makes for a more long-term complex pattern.One such moving part is a high pressure system that will move across the northern half of the country late in the week."The strength and location of the high pressure delivering cold to the northern tier of the country will determine how far north the storm is able to go," said AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Alan Reppert.No matter how far north the storm traverses, the likelihood of rain for states like Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee and Georgia from late on Thursday through Friday is pretty high.    The situation with the high pressure will instead determine the precipitation amount, and precipitation type for parts of Kentucky to the Carolinas and Virginia.Cold present in the Appalachians and to the east of the mountains when the storm arrives could allow wet snowflakes to mix in with the rainfall, especially during the morning and overnight hours."In this scenario, accumulating snow will be possible in parts of Virginia, and in the mountains of North Carolina," added Reppert.Residents will want to keep a close eye on this storm, and prepare for changeable conditions.Snow falling in the mid-Atlantic is not unprecedented for early November.Richmond's earliest accumulating snowfall, and even Raleigh earliest snowfall is during the first week of November. Snowflakes can come as early as October in these areas. The occurrence of accumulating snowfall in the higher elevations of the Appalachians is even more common.However, a snowy situation in Virginia and North Carolina at the end of the week is not set in stone.Should the high hang back farther to the west, so will the cold air. Instead of the cold being present during the arrival of the storm, it will follow the wet weather.    This second scenario, combined with a more northerly storm track, would minimize the presence of snow for most across the south. Instead, there is a slight chance for some wet snowflakes to mix in with rain in places like Delaware, Maryland and northern Virginia.Additionally, the storm may move faster, most locations away from the Carolina Coast and Florida would be dried out by Friday afternoon.Cold would be able to dive farther to the south, bringing a chill for many across the region, including northern Florida, where cities experienced a record-warm October.Much of the southern and eastern Untied States has seen its fair share of storminess as of late.Cities like D.C., Raleigh, Nashville and Atlanta all recorded above-normal precipitation for the month of October. In fact D.C., and Nashville had almost double the normal amount of rain they get during the month.Download the free AccuWeather app to see the latest forecast for your region.

Despite a perception that the outcry over the October 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi had left the Saudis chastened, critics of the kingdom are still being vigorously pursued with measures including arbitrary travel bans and harassment of their families, it said.  "Detaining citizens for peaceful criticism of the government's policies or human rights advocacy is not a new phenomenon in Saudi Arabia," the New York-based group said in a report.</p>

Abe conveyed Japan’s “basic stance” on bilateral issues in his exchange with Moon, the Tokyo-based Kyodo News agency said separately, citing the Japanese foreign ministry.The brief, 11-minute meeting at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Bangkok came as a long-simmering feud escalated into a trade-and-security dispute, leading to boycotts of Japanese imports and the decision to scrap an intelligence-sharing pact. The encounter followed a break-through meeting last month between Abe and South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon.Moon proposed high-level talks, if needed while Abe said every effort should be made to resolve the feud, Moon’s office said. Abe last met Moon in September 2018 and passed up a chance to meet him for formal talks during Group of 20 events in Osaka in June.The remarks were the most positive yet since South Korean courts issued a series of rulings last year backing the claims of Koreans forced to work for Japanese companies during the country’s 1910-45 occupation of the Korean Peninsula.Japan subsequently tightened restrictions on exports of key materials used by South Korean semi-conductor manufacturers. South Korea responded by moving to withdraw from a military intelligence-sharing pact with Japan.To contact the reporters on this story: Shinhye Kang in Seoul at skang24@bloomberg.net;Seyoon Kim in Seoul at skim7@bloomberg.net;Sophie Jackman in Tokyo at sjackman5@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Pae at ppae1@bloomberg.net, Brendan ScottFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.</p>

            <p>Former vice president Joe Biden's campaign staffers have begun playing down expectations in the Iowa caucuses in response to their candidate's underperformance in recent polls conducted in the first primary state.“I think we’re the only ones who don’t have to win Iowa, honestly," Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz told the Wall Street Journal, "because our strength is the fact that we have a broad and diverse coalition.”A Siena College/New York Times poll released Friday predicted Biden will take fourth place in the Iowa caucuses. Left-wing challengers Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders come in first and second respectively, with the more moderate Pete Buttigieg taking third place.The Iowa caucuses could “have three or four or five candidates all within a couple of percentage points. Does anybody win? Technically, yes, maybe," said Schultz. "But does that give you clarity on where the heart of the Democratic Party is? I would say, ‘no.’”Biden still leads the Democratic field in national polling. His team is hoping that Biden's wide support among black voters will help propel him to the front of the race in the primaries following Iowa.The former vice president has come out against Warren's and Sanders's promise of "medicare for all" plans in trying to win over more moderate voters.“The plan put forward by Bernie and Elizabeth, even out here, is not embraced by a majority of the people,” Biden said. “And so I think what people are going to start to focus on, at least I hope, is a little bit of . . . truth in advertising.”Warren released her universal Medicare plan on Friday. The plan require $21 trillion in new government spending over ten years, while Sanders's carries a $32 trillion price tag over the same period.</p>

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran has "trapped the other party in the corner of the ring in many cases," adding that U.S. aggression toward Iran has only grown "wilder and more flagrant" over the years.  Khamenei was quoted on his official website in a speech to thousands of students, a day before the 40th anniversary of the U.S. Embassy takeover in Tehran.</p>

            <h2>Knifeman stabs four in Hong Kong as mall clashes between protesters and police end in bloodshed</h2>
            <p>Date: Sun, 03 Nov 2019 08:14:17 -0500</p>
            <a href='https://news.yahoo.com/hong-kong-councillors-ear-bitten-131417672.html'>News link</a>
            <p>At least four people were injured by a blade-wielding man who rampaged through a mall in Hong Kong as riot police stormed shopping centres in a move to block protesters from staging rallies. The bloody attack took place amid a day of chaos in Hong Kong that also saw an elected local councillor have part of his left ear bitten off. Pro-democracy activists called a spate of flashmobs in shopping centers on Sunday in a bid to keep up the momentum of the protest movement that has swept the city with violent clashes for five months.  The actions came after a day of running battles on Saturday, and riot police stormed several malls early the day in an attempt to stop the rallies from taking place. Officers stationed at planned protest sites blocked certain areas, dispersed crowds and made arrests. Nonetheless, protesters succeeded in worming their way into malls in several neighbourhoods, forming a human chain, chanting slogans, and blocking entrances to prevent police officers from entering.

Footage circulating online showed that the attacker, thought to be wielding a knife, had been subdued by angry onlookers. He was said to have argued with others over political issues before the incident. Andrew Chiu, a pro-democracy councillor, lost part of his ear at the same mall. It was not immediately clear if the person who bit off his ear was the same person who carried out the knife attack.  Police said in a statement that they stormed into the shopping centres after activists started vandalising interiors and smashing windows.

Police arrested at least 200 people the previous night when another set of protests disrupted the city. The weekend's clashes were the latest bout of violence in Hong Kong's worst political crisis since the former British colony was returned to China in 1997.  Protests kicked off early June against an extradition bill that would have sent suspects to face trial in mainland China, where Communist Party influence in the court system results in a 99.9 per cent conviction rate. City leaders finally withdrew the plan last month, but activists have continued to demonstrate against what they describe as police brutality and overall frustration at a government they feel has refused to listen to them. The protesters' demands have expanded to include the resignation of Carrie Lam, the city's chief executive, establishment of an independent inquiry into police handling of the demonstrations, amnesty for arrested protesters, and direct leadership elections.

And while Ms Lam has refused to make further concessions, the clashes have grown increasingly violent. Police have deployed record amounts of tear gas, rubber bullets and sponge grenades, while a more radical faction of protesters now routinely throw petrol bombs and bricks and set fire to street barricades to deter police. Resentment at Hong Kong’s police force – once dubbed “Asia’s Finest” ­– is hardening as activists denounce what they say is disproportionate force. At least three candidates running in local elections were arrested by police over the weekend, including Richard Chan, 48, who was pepper sprayed at close range twice by officers.  Protesters have also begun targeting symbols of mainland China, including the Chinese flag, major state-owned Chinese banks, and businesses thought to be pro-Beijing, to show their frustration that freedoms long enjoyed in the former British colony were fast eroding under Beijing’s Communist rule.  On Saturday, protesters targeted the offices of Chinese state media agency Xinhua for the first time. Xinhua said in a statement that it strongly condemned the “barbaric acts of mobs” who vandalised and set fire to its lobby.</p>

The EU, China's largest trading partner, said last week ahead of the Shanghai fair that there was a risk of "promise fatigue", urging China to show "more ambition and genuine effort towards rebalancing and a level playing field".  China has long been dogged by allegations of unfair trade practices, from forced tech transfers to protectionist market entry policies.</p>

            <p>(Bloomberg) -- Venezuela gave El Salvadoran diplomats just 48 hours to leave the country after a similar move by El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele.The meltdown in foreign relations came amid an ongoing power struggle between sitting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and National Assembly leader Juan Guaido, who has declared himself president and says Maduro’s administration is illegitimate.El Salvador is awaiting new diplomatic representation from Guaido in the near future, according to a statement from the president’s office late Saturday. Bukele also gave Venezuelan diplomats 48 hours to leave.“The government of President Nayib Bukele recognizes the legitimacy of Interim President Juan Guaido, while free elections are held in accordance with the Venezuelan constitution,” the statement read. “El Salvador will always be in favor of democracy and will defend human rights.”Bukele responded to Venezuela’s announcement with a tweet on Sunday saying that he had forgotten to mention that his government had not named a single diplomat in Venezuela and that Maduro had kicked out the team named by his predecessor. He finished the tweet with an emoji crying with laughter.Seven countries have pulled their ambassadors from Venezuela since 2018, when Maduro organized presidential elections that were criticized by many as illegitimate.\--With assistance from Fabiola Zerpa.To contact the reporter on this story: Justin Villamil in Mexico City at jvillamil18@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Carolina Wilson at cwilson166@bloomberg.net, Kevin Miller, Mark NiquetteFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.</p>

            <p>Iran has worked to turn sweeping anti-government protests in Iraq from a threat to its hard-earned influence over its neighbour into an opportunity for political gains, analysts say.  In Lebanon too, where similar rallies against corruption and government inefficiency have broken out, Iran's main ally Hezbollah has managed to maintain its influence.  "Very clearly, Iran in both Lebanon and Iraq wants to protect the system and not allow it to fall apart," said Renad Mansour, researcher at London-based Chatham House.</p>

            <p>Hong Kong anti-government protesters crowded a shopping mall in running clashes with police on Sunday during which a man with a knife slashed several people and apparently bit off part of a local politician's ear.  A human chain in Cityplaza, in the eastern suburb of Taikoo Shing, turned into a face-to-face conflict with police, running up and down escalators where families with young children had been window shopping just minutes before and watching skating on the ice rink.  Police said protesters had vandalized a restaurant in the mall after a peaceful chanting of slogans in the 22nd straight weekend of protests by Hong Kong people furious at perceived Chinese meddling in the former British colony which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.</p>
